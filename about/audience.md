The long-term goal of this site is to help two large groups of people at APHC:
1) Public Health professionals who desire the ability to learn how to augment data in a quick and effecient manner in a short amount of time ; and 2) Free-range
learners, or professionals who aren't taking a formal class and are interested
in learning online on their own time. We aim to start with prublic health professionals in a distance learning type environment then attempt to build on the material generated to make
it maximally useful to the broader audience of public health professionals who want to
learn how to use programming and database management systems. We are
interested in helping folks who are complete beginners and those who
already have some programming background.

Examples of folks who we are trying to help:

**Allen:** An budding public health intern, part of the ORISE or other volunteer program
either realizes that computers are going to be important in public
health and epidemiology he ends up working or likes computers and thinks
learning about them be more fun than the other available electives. He
has never programmed before and doesn't really know what a database is.

**Jenny:** A mid-tier employee at APHC with a background in doing hands on
biology/epidemiology either in the lab or the field. A recipent of a graduate degree 
she's realized that managing the data she's collecting in a
reasonable way is going to be important (working with the hodge podge of
poorly structured spreadsheets that her lab uses is awful), and doing
all of the analysis that she needs to conduct for her assigned projects seems
like it would be a lot easier if it could be automated.

**Paul:** A senior level public health profession with little computer background 
who realizes that computing and data management has become so central to his area of research 
that he needs to at least have a rough idea of how his team memebers are working the
magic they do for projects with a lot of programming. Even better he'd
like to get to the point where he can really engage and help out.
